Wildlife photographer Farhan Qureshi fakes a heart attack to create an emergency landing of his flight upon receiving a phone call from Chatur "Silencer" Ramalingam, a former collegemate who tells him about the whereabouts of Farhan’s long-lost friend and collegemate, Ranchoddas “Rancho” Shyamaldas Chanchad. Along with fellow friend and former collegemate Raju Rastogi, he meets Chatur, who reminds them of a bet they had met 10 years ago in college, as to who will end up most successful, and boasts to them about his successful career in the United States.

Angered by his treatment of the rather trivial matter, Farhan and Raju initially berate him for his act, when Chatur reveals that his confidence stems from his awareness of Rancho's condition, as he has traced him to Shimla.

As Farhan, Raju and Chatur travel to Shimla, Farhan reminisces their college days at the Imperial College of Engineering, looked over by Director Viru “Virus” Sahastrabuddhe, who believes students must prioritize rote memorization and success over innovation and inventions; Farhan, despite having a passion for wildlife photography, was forced by his father to pursue engineering, while Raju came from a very poor family who depended on Raju and his career as last resort out of poverty. They were then joined by Rancho, an innovative young man hailing from a wealthy family with a passion for engineering, who challenged Virus’ views on learning and understanding engineering.

 After being insulted and embarrassed by Rancho and his antics at various instances, Virus intimidated Farhan and Raju by saying their future at the college would be compromised if they continue to associate with Rancho, and a frightened Raju subsequently moved into the door room of Chatur, an ideal student of Virus who believed in rote learning who takes pills to improve his learning but this has a side-effect of him farting silently, earning him the nickname "Silencer", with his Hindi skills pretty low. 
 
 However, Rancho embarrassed a condescending Chatur publicly by rewriting a speech the latter had to deliver at a college function, igniting the challenge to see who would be more successful.
 
  After Raju's ailing father developed a stroke, Rancho, with the help of Virus’ younger daughter Pia Sahastrabuddhe, a medical student, who was initially resentful of Rancho for insulting her father, took him to the hospital via her scooter.
  
   Following a reconciliation between Rancho and Raju, the trio attended the semester examinations
